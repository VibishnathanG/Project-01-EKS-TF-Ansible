**Project-01-EKS-TF-Ansible**

**Overview**

This project utilizes Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Terraform, and Ansible to automate the deployment and management of infrastructure and applications. Below, you'll find a detailed explanation of each technology stack.

**Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)**

**Description:**

Amazon EKS is a fully managed Kubernetes service. It simplifies the process of deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications using Kubernetes. With EKS, you can run Kubernetes applications without the need to install and operate your Kubernetes clusters.

**Key Features:**

-   Managed Kubernetes Control Plane: EKS provides a managed control plane that is highly available, secure, and always up-to-date.
-   Simplified Operations: It abstracts the complexity of managing Kubernetes, allowing developers to focus on applications.
-   Scalability: EKS scales with your application requirements, providing flexibility for growing workloads.

**Terraform**

**Description:**

Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool. It allows you to define and provision infrastructure using a declarative configuration language. Terraform supports multiple cloud providers and on-premises infrastructure, making it a versatile choice for managing infrastructure.

**Key Features:**

-   Declarative Syntax: Infrastructure is defined using a simple, human-readable configuration language.
-   Multi-Cloud Support: Terraform supports various cloud providers, allowing you to manage resources across different environments.
-   Versioning: Infrastructure changes are tracked and versioned, facilitating collaboration and change management.

**Ansible**

**Description:**

Ansible is an open-source automation tool that simplifies configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. It uses a simple YAML syntax to define tasks and plays, making it easy to understand and maintain.

**Key Features:**

-   Agentless: Ansible does not require agents on managed nodes, making it lightweight and easy to deploy.
-   Playbooks: Automation workflows are defined using playbooks, which are written in YAML.
-   Extensibility: Ansible can be extended through custom modules, allowing you to automate diverse tasks.
